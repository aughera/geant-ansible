# The GÉANT Ansible learning unit

This repo holds sample Ansible playbooks for the GÉANT OAV Ansible course.

These mostly consist of vEOS examples but there is a `show_version_juniper` example in `Section1/show_version/`.

Some of the files are accompanied by example output, e.g. `show_version.yaml` produced `show_version.output`.
